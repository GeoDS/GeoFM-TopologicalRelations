Let me start by understanding what each geometry is.\n","\n","Geometry A is a LINESTRING with several coordinates. It starts at (-89.3529, 43.045) and goes through multiple points ending back near the starting point, but not exactly the same. So it's essentially a line that connects these sequential points.\n","\n","Geometry B is a POINT located at (-89.3529, 43.0454). I notice that this point shares the same x-coordinate as the first and last points of Geometry A but has a slightly different y-coordinate (43.0454 compared to 43.045).\n","\n","Now, I need to determine the predicate between these two geometries using the DE-9IM model. The possible predicates are contains, within, touches, equals, crosses, disjoint, or overlaps.\n","\n","First, let's check if they are equal. Since Geometry A is a line and Geometry B is a point, they can't be equal because their types are different. So 'equals' is out of the question.\n","\n","Next, I'll consider if the point lies on the line. Looking at the coordinates, the point (-89.3529, 43.0454) seems to be very close to the starting and ending points of the line, which are both at y=43.045. The slight difference in y (from 43.045 to 43.0454) might mean it's not exactly on the line, but I need to check if it touches any part of the line.\n","\n","Since the point shares the same x-coordinate as the endpoints of the line and is very close in y, it's likely that the point lies along this vertical line segment. Therefore, the line contains the point.\n","\n","I don't think 'within' applies here because that usually refers to a polygon containing another geometry. 'Contains' seems appropriate since the line includes the point as part of its path.\n","</think>\n","\n","The point lies on the line string, making the predicate \"contains\".\n","\n","</answer>(LineString, contains, Point)</answer>, actual: ('LineString', 'contains', 'Point')\n","finish saving first 50 predictions of zero_shot, using deepseek_14b.\n","----------------\n","record 100 predict: <think>\n","Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given two geometries in WKT format: Geometry A is a LineString with several points, and Geometry B is another LineString with fewer points. My task is to determine their spatial relationship using one of the specified predicates.\n","\n","First, I'll parse the coordinates for both geometries to visualize them. Geometry A has six points that form a line, while Geometry B has four points forming its own line. Looking at the coordinates, it seems like both lines are in close proximity but not overlapping entirely.\n","\n","Next, I'll consider each predicate:\n","\n","1. **Contains**: This would mean every point of B is inside A. From the coordinates, B's points don't seem to lie within A.\n","2. **Within**: The reverse of contains; every point of A must be inside B. Again, since A has more and different points, this doesn't apply.\n","3. **Touches**: This occurs if they share a common boundary point but aren't overlapping. Looking at the coordinates, some endpoints might touch.\n","4. **Equals**: Only if both geometries are identical, which isn't the case here.\n","5. **Crosses**: If their paths intersect but aren't entirely overlapping or touching. The lines might cross each other.\n","6. **Disjoint**: No intersection at all. But given their coordinates, they likely share some points.\n","7. **Overlaps**: More than just crossing; significant overlap without being identical. This seems possible.\n","\n","After analyzing, I think the lines might touch at certain endpoints but don't entirely overlap or cross extensively. So, \"touches\" is the most accurate predicate here.\n","</think>\n","\n","The two LineStrings share common endpoint coordinates, indicating they touch each other at those points.\n","\n","<answer>(LineString, touches, LineString)</answer>, actual: ('LineString', 'crosses', 'LineString')\n","finish saving first 100 predictions of zero_shot, using deepseek_14b.\n","----------------\n","record 150 predict: <think>\n","Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to classify the spatial relationship between two geometries, A and B, using specific predicates from DE-9IM and OGC standards. The user has given me their WKT (Well-Known Text) formats, and I need to determine which predicate applies.\n","\n","First, let's parse what each geometry is. Geometry A is a LineString with coordinates ranging from (-89.4509 43.0401) to (-89.4509 43.0424). It seems like this line starts near point (-89.4509, 43.0401), goes through several points, and ends at the same x-coordinate but a higher y-value of 43.0424. So it's a vertical line segment.\n","\n","Geometry B is a Polygon with coordinates that form a more complex shape. Looking at the points, it starts at (-89.4527 43.0369), goes through several other points, and returns to the starting point. The polygon seems to cover an area around the LineString in Geometry A.\n","\n","Now, I need to determine how these two geometries relate spatially. The possible predicates are contains, within, touches, equals, crosses, disjoint, overlaps. Since neither is equal (they're different types—LineString vs. Polygon), 'equals' is out of the question.\n","\n","Let me visualize this: Geometry A is a vertical line segment near the middle of Geometry B's polygon. I need to see if the line is entirely inside the polygon or just overlapping part of it, or perhaps touching its boundary.\n","\n","I think about the 'contains' predicate, which means every point in A is also in B. Since A is a vertical line and B is a polygon that likely encloses this area, it's possible that the entire LineString is within the Polygon. Alternatively, if only part of the line is inside, maybe 'overlaps' would apply.\n","\n","Wait, but looking at the coordinates, the LineString starts and ends at (-89.4509 43.0401) and (-89.4509 43.0424). The Polygon's points include a point at (-89.4487 43.0401), which is close to the start of A but slightly west. Since the LineString is vertical, it might pass through the polygon.\n","\n","I should check if all points along the LineString are within the Polygon. If yes, then 'contains' applies. But if only part of the line is inside, maybe 'overlaps' or 'touches' would be more accurate.\n","\n","Given that Geometry B's polygon includes a point at (-89.4487 43.0401), which is east of A's start point, and considering the shape, it's likely that the LineString passes through the interior of the Polygon. Therefore, every point in A is within B.\n","\n","So, the correct predicate here would be 'within', but wait—'contains' is when B contains all points of A.

So it doesn't coincide.\n","\n","But perhaps the point lies close enough to be considered touching? Wait, no—touching in spatial terms usually means exact coincidence, not proximity.

If the point is not on the line string, then there's no crossing or touching, so they are disjoint. But I'm not sure if being near counts as overlapping. No, because overlapping usually applies to areas, and a point doesn't have an area.\n","\n","Alternatively, maybe the point is within the bounding box of the line string?

Geometry A is a polygon, and B is a line string. Since they have different types, they can't be equal. So 'equals' is out.\n","\n","Next, does the line touch the polygon?

Since both geometries are polygons, they can have various relationships such as overlapping, being contained within each other, touching at a boundary, etc.\n","\n","Looking at the WKT strings:\n","\n","- Geometry A is a polygon with coordinates: (-89.4735 43.0698), (-89.4735 43.0702), (-89.4733 43.0702), (-89.4733 43.0698), and back to the start.\n","- Geometry B is a polygon with coordinates: (-89.4784 43.0616), (-89.478 43.0747), (-89.4675 43.0743), (-89.4684 43.0717), (-89.4684 43.067), (-89.4722 43.0632), (-89.4721 43.0609), (-89.4785 43.0608), and back to the start.\n","\n","From these coordinates, it seems both polygons are relatively small areas near -89.47 longitude and around 43.06-43.07 latitude. \n","\n","To determine their relationship, I should plot or visualize these points. Geometry A's polygon appears to be a very narrow rectangle (almost like a line segment) since the x-coordinates vary slightly between -89.4735 and -89.4733, while y-coordinates go from 43.0698 to 43.0702. This suggests it's a very thin vertical line.\n","\n","Geometry B has more varied coordinates, spanning a larger area. Its x-coordinates range from -89.4784 to -89.4675 and y from 43.0616 to 43.0747. This polygon seems to cover a broader region.\n","\n","Given their positions, Geometry A is likely located within Geometry B since its coordinates fall entirely within the range of Geometry B's coordinates. To confirm this, I can check if all vertices of A are inside B or on its boundary.\n","\n","If A is entirely within B and there's no overlapping beyond that (since they're both polygons), then the predicate would be 'within'. If parts of A extend outside B, it might be 'overlaps', but given their coordinates, it seems A is fully contained.\n","\n","I should also consider if any edges touch or cross. But since all points of A are within B's bounds, touching or crossing isn't necessary. Also, they're not equal because their vertex counts and spans differ.\n","\n","Therefore, the most accurate predicate here is 'within'.\n","</think>\n","\n","The two polygons have coordinates that suggest Geometry A is entirely contained within Geometry B without any overlapping edges beyond containment. \n","\n","<answer>(Polygon, within, Polygon)</answer>, actual: ('Polygon', 'within', 'Polygon')\n","finish saving first 1400 predictions of zero_shot_dim, using deepseek_14b.\n"]}],"source":["from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\n","from langchain.chains import LLMChain\n","import time, re\n","\n","prompt_mode = 'zero_shot_dim'\n","\n","\n","\n","SYSTEM_PROMPT = \"\"\"You will be given the WKT format of geometries given the subject A and reference object B.\n","Classify their spatial relations into one of the following predicates: contains, within, touches, equals, crosses, disjoint, overlaps.\n","The predicates are defined by DE-9IM and Open Geospatial Consortium.

So, I've been given two geometries: Geometry A is a Point at coordinates (-89.299, 43.0437), and Geometry B is a Polygon defined by a series of points. The task is to classify their spatial relation into one of the specified predicates based on DE-9IM and OGC standards.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what each predicate means. The options are contains, within, touches, equals, crosses, disjoint, overlaps. From the user's note, if A equals B, we don't return 'within' or 'contains', so equality isn't an option here since one is a point and the other is a polygon.\\n\\nNext, I recall that DE-9IM defines spatial relations based on dimensions. For instance, a Point (Geometry A) can be within a Polygon (Geometry B), which would mean the predicate is 'within'. Conversely, if the Polygon contains the Point, the predicate would be 'contains'.\\n\\nLooking at Geometry A's coordinates (-89.299, 43.0437), I should check whether this point lies inside the polygon defined by Geometry B. The polygon's vertices are listed, and plotting them or calculating their bounds could help determine if the point is within.\\n\\nI can start by checking if the x and y coordinates of the point fall within the bounding box of the polygon. Looking at the polygon's points, the x-coordinates range from approximately -89.3357 to -89.2868, and the y-coordinates range from about 43.0261 to 43.0481. The point's x is -89.299, which falls within the x-range of the polygon, and its y is 43.0437, also within the y-range.\\n\\nThis suggests that the point might be inside the polygon. To confirm, I'd need to perform a point-in-polygon test. This involves checking if the point lies on the interior side of any of the polygon's edges. Since I don't have plotting tools here, I can reason based on the coordinates.\\n\\nGiven that all the vertices around -89.3 and 43.04 are close to the point's location, it's likely inside. Therefore, the predicate would be 'within', meaning Geometry B contains Geometry A within its boundaries.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe Point is located at (-89.299, 43.0437), which falls within the bounding box and likely inside the Polygon based on coordinates.\\n\\n</answer>(Point, within, Polygon)</answer>\",\n          \"<think>\\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the spatial relationship between two geometries A and B based on their WKT formats. Both are polygons with nearly identical coordinates but let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I'll look at Geometry A:\\nPOLYGON ((-89.5107 43.0763, -89.51 43.0752, -89.5139 43.0752, -89.5139 43.076, -89.5134 43.0772, -89.51196 43.07704, -89.5116 43.077, -89.5107 43.0763))\\n\\nAnd Geometry B:\\nPOLYGON ((-89.5507 43.0763, -89.51 43.0752, -89.5139 43.0752, -89.5139 43.076, -89.5134 43.0772, -89.51196 43.07704, -89.5116 43.077, -89.5507 43.0763))\\n\\nWait a minute, I notice that the first coordinate of B is (-89.5507, 43.0763) and the last is (-89.5507, 43.0763), which seems like it's closing the polygon but starts at a different point than A.\\n\\nLooking closer, most of the coordinates between A and B are the same except for the first one in B being (-89.5507 instead of -89.5107). So, does that mean they're identical except for a slight variation in the starting point?\\n\\nWait, no, because if you look at the points, after the first coordinate, both A and B have the same sequence until the end. But wait, actually, let me list them out.\\n\\nA's coordinates:\\n1. (-89.5107, 43.0763)\\n2. (-89.51, 43.0752)\\n3. (-89.5139, 43.0752)\\n4. (-89.5139, 43.076)\\n5. (-89.5134, 43.0772)\\n6. (-89.51196, 43.07704)\\n7. (-89.5116, 43.077)\\n8. Back to (-89.5107, 43.0763)\\n\\nB's coordinates:\\n1. (-89.5507, 43.0763)\\n2. (-89.51, 43.0752)\\n3. (-89.5139, 43.0752)\\n4. (-89.5139, 43.076)\\n5. (-89.5134, 43.0772)\\n6. (-89.51196, 43.07704)\\n7. (-89.5116, 43.077)\\n8. Back to (-89.5507, 43.0763)\\n\\nSo, except for the first and last points, all other points are identical. Now, I need to determine if these two polygons are equal.\\n\\nWait a second, in WKT, the order of vertices matters for defining the polygon's edges. If the starting point is different but the rest of the points are the same, does that make them different? Or since they both form the same shape just traversed differently?\\n\\nActually, no. Because the first and last points define the closure. So in A, it starts at (-89.5107, 43.0763) and ends there, while B starts at (-89.5507, 43.0763) and ends there. The middle points are the same.\\n\\nWait, but looking closely, I realize that in A, after point 1, it goes to (-89.51, 43.0752), which is a different x-coordinate than the first point. In B, after the first point, it also goes to (-89.51, 43.0752). So both polygons have the same sequence of points except for their starting and ending points.\\n\\nBut wait, in A, the starting point is included again at the end, making a closed polygon. In B, the first point is different but also repeated at the end. However, since all other points are identical, does that mean they form the same shape?\\n\\nWait no, because the first point in B is (-89.5507, 43.0763), which is a different location than A's starting point. So actually, they have entirely different vertices except for points 2 to 7.\\n\\nBut wait, looking at the coordinates again: In A, after point 1, it goes to (-89.51, ...). But in B, after point 1 (-89.5507), it also goes to (-89.51, ...). So, both polygons have a sequence of points that includes (-89.51, ...) and others, but A starts at (-89.5107) while B starts further west at (-89.5507).\\n\\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the coordinates.\\n\\nGeometry A:\\nStarts at (-89.5107, 43.0763)\\nThen goes to (-89.51, 43.0752), which is slightly east and south.\\nThen continues with other points, ending back at (-89.5107, 43.0763).\\n\\nGeometry B:\\nStarts at (-89.5507, 43.0763)\\nThen goes to (-89.51, 43.0752), same as A.\\nContinues with the same points until it ends back at (-89.5507, 43.0763).\\n\\nSo, in essence, Geometry B has an additional point at (-89.5507, 43.0763) which is not present in A, and A has a different starting/ending point.\\n\\nWait no, actually, both polygons have the same middle points, but their first and last points are different. So, they're not identical because one starts and ends at (-89.5107, 43.0763) while the other starts and ends at (-89.5507, 43.0763).\\n\\nBut then, do these polygons share all their edges except for the first and last segments? Or are they entirely different?\\n\\nWait, no. Because in A, after point 1, it goes to point 2 (-89.51, ...), but in B, after point 1 (-89.5507, ...), it also goes to (-89.51, ...). So the edge from (-89.5507, ...) to (-89.51, ...) is present only in B, while A has a different first edge.\\n\\nTherefore, these two polygons have different vertices and edges, except for points 2 through 7. But since they start and end at different points, their overall shapes are different.\\n\\nWait, but looking again: In both cases, the sequence after the first point is identical. So in A, it's a polygon starting at P1, then P2-P8 (which loops back to P1). In B, it's starting at Q1, then P2-P7, and back to Q1.\\n\\nTherefore, they share points P2 through P7 but have different first and last points. So their edges are not the same because A has an edge from P1 to P2, while B has an edge from Q1 to P2, which is a different edge.\\n\\nThus, the two polygons are not identical because their vertex sets differ: A has vertices {P1, P2, ..., P8}, while B has {Q1, P2, ..., P7, Q1}. Since Q1 \\u2260 P1, they have different vertices and edges.\\n\\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of points. Let me recount:\\n\\nA: 8 points (including the repeated first at the end)\\nB: 8 points as well.\\n\\nWait no, both start with a point, then have seven more, ending with the same starting point.\\n\\nSo A has vertices P1, P2, ..., P7, P1\\nB has Q1, P2, ..., P7, Q1\\n\\nTherefore, their vertex sets are different because one includes P1 and excludes Q1, while B includes Q1 and excludes P1 (assuming P1 \\u2260 Q1).\\n\\nHence, the two polygons are not equal because they have different vertices.\\n\\nWait, but in reality, looking at the coordinates:\\n\\nIn A: First point is (-89.5107, 43.0763)\\nIn B: First point is (-89.5507, 43.0763)\\n\\nSo they are different points.\\n\\nTherefore, the two polygons have different vertex sets and thus are not equal.\\n\\nWait a minute, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. If all other vertices except the first and last are identical, does that make them the same polygon? No, because the order of vertices defines the edges, so even if they share some points, the overall shape would differ if any vertex is different.\\n\\nSo in this case, since A starts at P1 and B starts at Q1 (different points), their polygons are not equal.\\n\\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe when you have a polygon with the same vertices except for one point, it's still considered different. So yes, they're different.\\n\\nTherefore, these two polygons are not equal; thus, the answer is that they are not equal.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe polygons are not equal because their vertex sets differ. Geometry A starts and ends at (-89.5107, 43.0763), while Geometry B starts and ends at (-89.5507, 43.0763). Although they share some vertices, the differing starting/ending points make them distinct.\\n\\n$\\\\boxed{\\\\text{No}}$\",\n          \"<think>\\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. I'm given two geometries in WKT format: Geometry A is a LINESTRING with coordinates (-89.3476 43.1052, -89.3474 43.1052), and Geometry B is another LINESTRING with coordinates (-89.3476 43.1052, -89.3475 43.1052). I need to classify their spatial relation using one of the seven predicates: contains, within, touches, equals, crosses, disjoint, overlaps.\\n\\nI remember that according to DE-9IM and OGC standards, certain predicates are valid based on the dimensions (points, lines) of the geometries involved. Since both A and B are LineStrings, I need to consider how two line strings relate in terms of their spatial relationships.\\n\\nLet me break down each geometry:\\n\\nGeometry A: It has two points. The first point is (-89.3476, 43.1052) and the second is (-89.3474, 43.1052). So, this line starts at -89.3476 and goes to -89.3474 in longitude, keeping the same latitude.\\n\\nGeometry B: Similarly, it has two points. The first is the same as Geometry A's starting point (-89.3476, 43.1052), and the second is (-89.3475, 43.1052). So, this line starts at -89.3476 and goes to -89.3475 in longitude.\\n\\nComparing the two LineStrings:\\n\\n- Both start at the same point (-89.3476, 43.1052).\\n- Geometry A extends from -89.3476 to -89.3474.\\n- Geometry B extends from -89.3476 to -89.3475.\\n\\nSo, the first point of both lines is identical. The second point of Geometry A is at a slightly different longitude than that of Geometry B. Specifically, Geometry A's endpoint is at -89.3474, which is eastward (since lower negative numbers mean east) compared to Geometry B's endpoint at -89.3475.\\n\\nNow, I need to determine the spatial predicate between these two LineStrings.\\n\\nLet me go through each possible predicate:\\n\\n1. **Contains**: This would mean that all of B's points are within A. But looking at their coordinates, B extends beyond A in one direction (from -89.3476 to -89.3475), which is beyond where A ends (-89.3474). So, contains doesn't apply because part of B lies outside A.\\n\\n2. **Within**: This would mean all of A's points are within B. However, A extends from -89.3476 to -89.3474, while B goes only up to -89.3475. So, the part of A beyond -89.3475 is outside B, meaning A isn't entirely within B.\\n\\n3. **Touches**: This implies that the geometries share a common boundary point but do not overlap otherwise. Since both lines start at (-89.3476, 43.1052), they share this exact point. Additionally, since their other points are along the same line (same latitude), I need to check if they only touch at that starting point or if they overlap more.\\n\\nWait a minute, both LineStrings start at the same point and then diverge. However, because they're lines, even if they share an endpoint, they might be considered as touching only at that point. But in reality, since they are colinear beyond that point (same latitude), their paths continue along the same line from (-89.3476 onwards). So, after the shared starting point, they extend in the same direction but with different endpoints.\\n\\nSo, do they touch? Well, they share a common endpoint, which is enough for 'touches' to apply because they meet at that point without overlapping elsewhere.\\n\\nBut wait, let me double-check. If two lines share an endpoint, does that count as touching? According to DE-9IM, the dimension of their intersection would be 0 (a point), and since both are lines, their MBRs intersect only at that point, which means they touch but do not overlap.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I consider 'overlaps', it's when the interiors intersect. But in this case, since their paths diverge after the shared endpoint, there is no overlapping area beyond just the starting point.\\n\\nSo, 'touches' seems correct here because they share a common boundary point (the starting point) and do not overlap elsewhere.\\n\\n4. **Equals**: This would mean both geometries are exactly the same. But looking at their coordinates, Geometry A goes from -89.3476 to -89.3474, while B goes up to -89.3475. Since these are different endpoints, they are not equal.\\n\\n5. **Crosses**: This would require that the lines intersect in such a way that their interiors cross each other, which isn't the case here since they only share an endpoint.\\n\\n6. **Disjoint**: They are not disjoint because they do share a common point.\\n\\n7. **Overlaps**: As mentioned earlier, overlaps occur when the interiors intersect, but since they diverge after the shared starting point, there's no overlapping area beyond that point.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct predicate is 'touches'.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together:
